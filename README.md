# JournalFlow Backend Project
## Overview
JournalFlow is a robust backend project designed to streamline the management of journal entries. It provides essential functionalities such as CRUD operations, MongoDB integration, transactional annotation for data consistency, JWT authentication for secure access, YAML configuration for flexibility, email notifications, and task scheduling.

## Features
- CRUD Operations: Allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete journal entries, providing full control over data management.
- MongoDB Integration: Utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for efficient storage and retrieval of journal data.
- Transactional Annotation: Implements transactional annotations to ensure data consistency and integrity during database operations.
- MongoDB Atlas: Configures MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted database management, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- Spring Security (JWT Authentication): Integrates Spring Security with JWT authentication, ensuring secure access to journal data and protecting against unauthorized access.
- YAML Configuration: Employs YAML for structured configuration management, allowing easy customization and maintenance of application settings.
- JUnit Testing: Implements JUnit tests to validate the functionality and reliability of backend operations, ensuring robustness and stability.
- Mockito: Utilizes Mockito for mocking dependencies in unit tests, enhancing test coverage and effectiveness.
- Email Functionality: Integrates email functionality for notifications and communication within the system, enhancing user engagement and communication.
- Scheduling Tasks: Implements task scheduling for automated processes and periodic tasks, ensuring timely execution of important operations.
